# Advanced Shopify Theme Development: Class Project
This repository contains the starting point for the class project for my free
Skillshare course, "[Advanced Shopify Theme Development]".

For details on the objectives of the project, read the [class project page].


## Setting up the project
The easiest way to get started is by downloading the theme [as a ZIP file],
creating a development Shopify store, and uploading the zipped theme file to
that store.

To populate your store with some fake products, Shopify has made a number of
product import CSV files available for use by developers. I highly recommend you
use these to get a range of realistic products into your store without much
fuss.

[Learn how to download and import sample product CSVs.]

After the chosen CSV has finished importing, or you've added some products 
yourself manually, create one or two collections containing different product
ranges.

Once you've imported the products and successfully uploaded the initial version
of the theme, you should have something similar to
https://skillshare-project.myshopify.com ready for editing.


## Getting help
If you need help with any of the project tasks, head to the [community page] on
Skillshare and post your question! It's better to do this than contacting me
directly, so that students have the chance to help each other out and also so
that everyone can benefit from the discussion.
 
 
## Uploading your project
Once you've completed the project tasks, make sure you show off your work! Head
to the [project gallery] and upload a link to your development store, along with
a screenshot of your design.


## Thanks
A huge thanks to both Shopify and Skillshare for making this course possible.
Special thanks to Keir Whitaker (Shopify) and Elliot Curtis (Skillshare).
